# Financial Awareness Survey ðŸ§ ðŸ’°

## Overview

This project is my **final assignment** for the **Code in Place** course offered by **Stanford University**. It is a simple Python-based command-line application designed to assess an individualâ€™s financial literacy awareness through 10 reflective yes/no questions. Based on the userâ€™s responses, the program calculates a score and provides personalized, actionable suggestions to improve financial habits.

## Motivation

Financial literacy is a crucial life skill that impacts everyoneâ€™s well-being. Many people lack awareness of fundamental financial concepts such as budgeting, saving, and investing. This project aims to help users self-assess their financial awareness in a friendly, non-judgmental way and encourage them to take small, manageable steps towards better money management.
